## Factors to calculate the voltage for the scanner from the position of the scan pattern in mm
# Linear factor for the x-axis in V / mm
FactorX = 0.866571
# Offset for the x-axis in V
OffsetX = 0.03
# Linear factor for the y-axis in V / mm
FactorY = -0.829098
# Offset for the y-axis in V
OffsetY = -0.03

# The offset of the reference stage in mm
ReferenceStageOffset_mm = 40

## The following parameters influence only the scan pattern (camera overlay) and valid scan range.
## To change the settings for the video camera image use the VideoCamera-entries below.
# The px/mm ratio in x-direction
CameraScalingX = 38.3464
# The px/mm ratio in y-direction
CameraScalingY = 38.3464
# Angle between the coordinate system of the scanner and video camera
CameraAngle = 0.1
# Polynomial coefficients (15 values) for the 2D-polynomial of degree 4 which is used for the image field correction
# Array with no default entry. If not found, look for ImageField.dat in configPath(historical reason)
